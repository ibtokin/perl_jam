This is my first time working with Perl. It's been, uh.... interesting.
Relevant xkcd: https://xkcd.com/224/

To use the csv_sorter.pl program, simply add a .csv filename as a command line argument, like so:

  ~ User$ perl csv_sorter.pl input.csv


Notes: 
*I am aware that it's best practice to use 3 arguments with open(). Maybe after sleep.
